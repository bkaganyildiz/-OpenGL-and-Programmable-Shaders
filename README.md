# -OpenGL-and-Programmable-Shaders

I have implemented an OpenGL program using vertex and fragment
shaders to display a texture image as a height map. I have determined the surface color using
Phong shading and texture mapping together.
I have implemented a camera flight mode to be able to fly over the visualized terrain. The
camera will have a gaze direction, which will be modeled by two angles for pitch and yaw.

Some of the keyboard shortcuts : 

'q' keyboard key disable the texture color 
'e' keyboard key enable the texture color 
'w,a,s,d' keyboard key rotation 
'u' keyboard key speed up 
'j' keyboard key speed down 
'x' keyboard key stop walkthrough 
'o' keyboard key increase height factor 
'l' keyboard key decrease height factor 
't' keyboard key enables the polygonMode on 
'g' keyboard key disables the polygonMode    

Some of the inputs and their outputs :
